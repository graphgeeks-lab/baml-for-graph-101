Under the terms of the scheme implementation deed, De Grey shareholders will be entitled to receive 0.119 new Northern Star shares for each De Grey share held at the scheme’s record date. This represents an implied offer price of $2.08 per De Grey share. The scheme consideration represents a 37.1 per cent premium to De Grey’s last closing share price of $1.52 per share on November 29. De Grey is currently developing the Hemi gold project in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, which has a mineral resource estimate of 264 million tonnes at 1.3 grams per tonne of gold for 11.2 million ounces (Moz) and is forecasted to produce 530,000 ounces per annum over its first 10 years. Acquiring De Grey will provide Northern Star access to a low-cost, long-life and large-scale gold development project. “The acquisition of De Grey is strongly aligned with Northern Star’s strategy and contributes to our purpose of generating superior returns for shareholders,” Northern Star managing director and chief executive officer Stuart Tonkin said. “De Grey’s Hemi development project will deliver a low-cost, long-life and large-scale gold mine in the Tier 1 jurisdiction of Western Australia, enhancing the quality of Northern Star’s asset portfolio to generate cash earnings.”  Once the scheme has been implemented, Northern Star shareholders will own approximately 80.1 per cent of the combined entity and De Grey shareholders will own the balance. The scheme has been unanimously recommended by the De Grey board. “Given the high-quality nature of Hemi, De Grey is in the fortunate position to have had many avenues to progress the asset, including M&A (mergers and acquisitions),” De Grey managing director Glenn Jardine said.\n    \"#\n  }\n  @@assert({{ this.parent_company == \"Northern Star Resources\" }})\n  @@assert({{ this.child_company == \"De Grey Mining\" }})\n}\n\ntest Test3 {\n  functions [ExtractAcquisitionInfo]\n  args {\n    text #\"\n      Ramelius to acquire Spartan for $2.4bn\n      Ramelius Resources is set to acquire the remaining Spartan Resources shares it does not own for approximately $2.4 billion.

Sayona has nominated its managing director and chief executive officer Lucas Dow, along with James Brown, Allan Buckler and Laurie Lefcourt.“I am delighted to announce the nomination of this highly experienced and capable group of leaders to form the board of Elevra Lithium,” Dow said.“Their diverse expertise across mining, legal, finance, and commercial strategy will be instrumental in steering our newly combined entity towards a successful and sustainable future.“As we integrate Sayona and Piedmont Lithium, this board will provide the strategic oversight required to unlock the full potential of our assets and deliver long-term value for our shareholders.”Piedmont has nominated its chair designate Dawne Hickton, and Christina Alvord, Jeff Armstrong and Jorge M.

The North American Lithium (NAL) operation in Québec is jointly owned by Sayona and Piedmont via a 75:25 partnership. NAL has produced approximately 140,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate since its restart in March 2023. By merging, Sayona and Piedmont will consolidate NAL’s ownership.“The formation of Elevra Lithium will mark a defining moment in the North American lithium industry,” Dow said.“With a strengthened balance sheet, simplified ownership structure, and a world-class asset portfolio, we will be poised to accelerate our growth strategy and enhance our ability to meet the rising global demand for lithium.“Our commitment to operational excellence, cost reduction and innovation will drive efficiencies across our projects, ensuring that we maximise the benefits of this merger.“The synergies between Sayona and Piedmont Lithium will allow us to optimise our production capabilities, streamline logistics, and expand our reach in key markets.\n    \"#\n  }\n  @@assert({{ this.merged_entity == \"Elevra Lithium\" }})\n}\n\ntest Test2 {\n  functions [ExtractMergerInfo]\n  args {\n    text #\"\n      Karora says ‘yes’ to $3.4b Westgold merger\n      Karora Resources shareholders have almost unanimously voted in favour of the company’s merger with Westgold.
