# Getting started with BAML for graphs

Code for the [Getting started with BAML for graphs](https://lu.ma/lvzwsan1) workshop with GraphGeeks.

The goal is to show how to use BAML for creating and querying knowledge graphs with LLMs!

## Setup

It's recommended to [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to manage the dependencies.

```bash
uv sync
```
Alternatively, you can install the dependencies manually via pip.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
